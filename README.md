- 👋 Hi, I’m @tidy-stacks! 
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Web Development, and Game Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and hanging out on Codecademy and TryHackMe to continue grinding out a better skill set.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I'm a lifelong learner and here to get better then I was the day before.
- 📫 How to reach me you can find me on LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter using the same handle. 

✨ The projects you are viewing on here are mostly things I've crafted for homework during my cybersecurity bootcamp experience. Though, I am including a couple of coding projects of a couple of other things I made a long the way. This includes my A-Frame VR project, two versions of a Tea Mongers website, and a bootstrap project. I will always be adding more to this because I love learning new things and building up my skill-set! ✨
